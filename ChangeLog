* Fri Jul 25 2014 Alfred Klomp <alfred@1afa.com> 0.22.2
- Add log configuration instructions to README.md;
- Remove custom Logger class, use stock Log4php singleton everywhere instead;

* Mon Jul 21 2014 Alfred Klomp <alfred@1afa.com> 0.22.1
- Fix showstopper typo in server.php (Issue #21)

* Thu Jul 17 2014 Alfred Klomp <alfred@1afa.com> 0.22
- Move files into a PSR-0 dir structure, load with Composer;
- VCardParser/VCardProducer: rename to Parser/Producer;
- Rename Zarafa_Store class to Store;
- Rename Zarafa_Folder class to Folder;
- Rename Zarafa_Webaccess_Settings class to just WebaccessSettings;
- Rename Zarafa_Bridge class to just Bridge;
- Backends: remove Zarafa_ prefix from classname;
- Place "our" classes in the SabreZarafa namespace;
- Move restrict functions to separate class;
- SabreDAV 2.0: fix runtime error by removing obsolete constant;
- SabreDAV 2.0: update Proppatch handler to the SabreDAV way of doing things;
- Update composer.json to pull in SabreDAV 2.0; also add author names.
- Change FALSE() functions to comparisons with the 'false' constant, to make
  the code more standard.
- Introduce the INCLUDE_SHARED_ADDRESSBOOKS config option to pull in address
  books shared with different users.
- Split off the Webaccess settings into separate class: the ZarafaBridge class
  is getting a bit bloated.
- Add support for shared addressbooks. Thanks to @erwint for donating the core
  logic: https://github.com/erwint/sabre-zarafa/
- ZarafaBridge: add method to get the Zarafa Webaccess settings, which we will
  need shortly in order to find the user's shared folders.
- VCardParser: first collect all email addresses, then sort them in order of
  preference as given by client. Previously the addresses were saved in source
  order, the first three to appear made it to Zarafa.
- FAX,OTHER maps to 'primary_fax_number' and vice versa, which follows the
  convention used by Zarafa Webmail and OSX Addressbook;
- FAX property now maps to 'business_fax_number', which is what Zarafa Webmail
  uses, likewise with TEL,WORK and 'office_telephone_number';
- Fix for a really common bug: avoid PHP fatal error in the folder name
  substitution code by checking if an array value is set before trying to
  access it;

- Use shorthand notation to get property parameters; just as good as the long
  version, but way more readable.
- Don't discard values for website and IM when we don't have any MAPI slots
  left; compress their values into a single MAPI slot by making a
  comma-separated list.
- Zarafa_Folder: add support for renaming folders according to a user-defined
  template; this helps in the situation where a public and a private folder
  have the same name.

* Wed Jun 05 2013 Alfred Klomp <alfred@bokxing-it.nl> 0.20
- VCardProducer: change SORT-AS tag to SORT-STRING; SORT-AS comes into play in
  vCard 4.0 as a parameter to the N property; generate it as such.
- VCardParser: add support for many proprietary phone/relation properties.
- Update README.md, add documentation.
- Bugfix: don't display mobile phone number twice.
- VCardParser: add a slew of proprietary instant messaging properties to the IM
  property matcher.
- Migrate the code to Sabre-VObject 3.0.0 format; make backwards-incompatible
  changes that break Sabre-VObject 2.x. The breakage is necessary because
  Sabre-VObject 3.0 breaks compatibility. We need to migrate to Sabre-VObject
  3.0 because it has proper support for escaping multiline fields, such as the
  NOTE: property. These fields break in 2.x.
- Don't parse the REV: tag as a Unix timestamp, and don't fill it with the
  lastmodified timestamp when creating a VCard. Turns out Evolution sets this
  property to a MD5 hash.

* Tue May 28 2013 Alfred Klomp <alfred@bokxing-it.nl> 0.19
- VCardParser and VCardProducer: clean up function interfaces, improve
  encapsulation, split large methods into smaller ones.
- Add ETag support, based on the hash of the EntryID and the last-modified
  timestamp. This should be sufficiently unique. Add a config option to turn
  this feature off if desired. Creating contacts now works in OSX Contacts.
- VCardParser: remove superfluous escaping functions; VObject handles that now;
- VCardParser: rewrite contact photo logic, the old code did not properly
  recognize differences between uppercase and lowercase encoding strings. Also
  build in some more checks, notably the check if the GD extension is loaded
  before trying to use it.
- VCardProducer: don't error out when email display name not found;
- Create separate logging class, which will try to load log4php but silently
  fail if that component is not installed; this loosens the dependency on
  log4php.

* Mon Apr 22 2013 Alfred Klomp <alfred@bokxing-it.nl> 0.18
- Tag version 0.18

  release at time of writing;
