- VCardParser and VCardProducer: clean up function interfaces, improve
  encapsulation, split large methods into smaller ones.
- Add ETag support, based on the hash of the EntryID and the last-modified
  timestamp. This should be sufficiently unique. Add a config option to turn
  this feature off if desired. Creating contacts now works in OSX Contacts.
- VCardParser: remove superfluous escaping functions; VObject handles that now;
- VCardParser: rewrite contact photo logic, the old code did not properly
  recognize differences between uppercase and lowercase encoding strings. Also
  build in some more checks, notably the check if the GD extension is loaded
  before trying to use it.
- VCardProducer: don't error out when email display name not found;
- Create separate logging class, which will try to load log4php but silently
  fail if that component is not installed; this loosens the dependency on
  log4php.
