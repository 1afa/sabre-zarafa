- Zarafa_Folder: add support for renaming folders according to a user-defined
  template; this helps in the situation where a public and a private folder
  have the same name.

- VCardProducer: change SORT-AS tag to SORT-STRING; SORT-AS comes into play in
  vCard 4.0 as a parameter to the N property; generate it as such.
- VCardParser: add support for many proprietary phone/relation properties.
- Update README.md, add documentation.
- Bugfix: don't display mobile phone number twice.
- VCardParser: add a slew of proprietary instant messaging properties to the IM
  property matcher.
- Migrate the code to Sabre-VObject 3.0.0 format; make backwards-incompatible
  changes that break Sabre-VObject 2.x. The breakage is necessary because
  Sabre-VObject 3.0 breaks compatibility. We need to migrate to Sabre-VObject
  3.0 because it has proper support for escaping multiline fields, such as the
  NOTE: property. These fields break in 2.x.
- Don't parse the REV: tag as a Unix timestamp, and don't fill it with the
  lastmodified timestamp when creating a VCard. Turns out Evolution sets this
  property to a MD5 hash.

- VCardParser and VCardProducer: clean up function interfaces, improve
  encapsulation, split large methods into smaller ones.
- Add ETag support, based on the hash of the EntryID and the last-modified
  timestamp. This should be sufficiently unique. Add a config option to turn
  this feature off if desired. Creating contacts now works in OSX Contacts.
- VCardParser: remove superfluous escaping functions; VObject handles that now;
- VCardParser: rewrite contact photo logic, the old code did not properly
  recognize differences between uppercase and lowercase encoding strings. Also
  build in some more checks, notably the check if the GD extension is loaded
  before trying to use it.
- VCardProducer: don't error out when email display name not found;
- Create separate logging class, which will try to load log4php but silently
  fail if that component is not installed; this loosens the dependency on
  log4php.
