	 * Updates one ore more webdav properties on a principal.

	 * is a propertyname, such as {DAV:}displayname.
	 *
	 * Each value is the actual value to be updated. If a value is null, it
	 * must be deleted.
	 *
	 * This method should be atomic. It must either completely succeed, or
	 * completely fail. Success and failure can simply be returned as
	 * 'true' or 'false'.
	 *
	 * It is also possible to return detailed failure information. In that
	 * case an array such as this should be returned:
	 *
	 * array(
	 *   200 => array(
	 *      '{DAV:}prop1' => null,

	 *      '{DAV:}prop4' => null,
	 *   ),
	 * );
	 *
	 * In this previous example prop1 was successfully updated or deleted,
	 * and prop2 was succesfully created.
	 *
	 * prop3 failed to update due to '403 Forbidden' and because of this
	 * prop4 also could not be updated with '424 Failed dependency'.
	 *
	 * This last example was actually incorrect. While 200 and 201 could
	 * appear in 1 response, if there's any error (403) the other
	 * properties should always fail with 423 (failed dependency).
	 *
	 * But anyway, if you don't want to scratch your head over this, just
	 * return true or false.

	 * @param array $mutations
